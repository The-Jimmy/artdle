# Artdle 🎨🟩🟨⬛

Artdle is a Python project that **recreates art patterns using Wordle rules**.  
You give it:
- **Today's Wordle answer**  
- A custom art pattern made of `c` (colored) and `b` (blank) tiles

It then finds valid 5-letter Wordle words that match your pattern — line by line — and outputs them to form your “Wordle art.”

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Load Wordle words**  
   Reads all valid 5-letter Wordle words from `valid-wordle-words.txt`.

2. **Ask for today's Wordle answer**  
   You type in the real Wordle answer for the day.

3. **Design your art**  
   You enter each line of your art using:
   - `c` → Green-colored tile (letter in correct position)  
   - `b` → Blank/gray tile (letter not in that position)  
   Example for a heart shape:

4. **Find matching words**  
For each line, the program finds a valid Wordle word that fits your pattern.

5. **Display the result**  
Shows your final Wordle art made out of real valid Wordle words.
